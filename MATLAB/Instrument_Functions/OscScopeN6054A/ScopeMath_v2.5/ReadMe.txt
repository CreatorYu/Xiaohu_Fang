Short getting started guide for ScopeMath

ScopeMath illustrates how to collect data from an oscilloscope and use MATLAB to perform mathematical calculations and visualizations with the data. Combining MATLAB with your oscilloscope transforms the scope into a complete test bench station. In one device, you now have direct access to reliable scope measurements as well as advanced dataanalysis and report generation capabilities.

The demo was created using the MATLAB Instrument Control Toolbox. The toolbox provides features for communicating with instruments such as oscilloscopes and function generators. Support is provided for GPIB, VISA, serial, TCP/IP, and UDP communication protocols. Additionally, the Instrument Control Toolbox supports VXIplug&play and IVI instrument drivers. 

Set up
1. Unpack the file ScopeMath.zip to directory ScopeMath on your disk
2. In MATLAB navigate to the directory ScopeMath
	For example if your directory ScopeMath is located directly on disk C:\ type in MATLAB Command Line:

      > cd c:\ScopeMath
      
3. Run script setup.m:
      Type in MATLAB Command Line:
      
      > setupScopeMath

4. Run ScopeMath application
   	Type in MATLAB Command Line:
	
	> ScopeMath
      
      
3) See file ScopeMath\help\ScopeMAthHelpDoc.html for the ScopeMath documentation
